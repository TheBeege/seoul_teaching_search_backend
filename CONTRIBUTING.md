# Contributing

## Code of Conduct
Don't be a dick. There's a popular Code of Conduct around there around inclusivity and such. Assume that's copied and pasted here. I'm just feeling lazy right now. A PR including that CoC is welcome.

## Communication
This project is being coordinated via the [CodeSeoul Discord](https://discord.gg/HFknCs8) and [FreeCodeCamp Korea Discord](https://discord.gg/ESYY8jmCvs).

## Standards
* While GraphQL may be a better for this specific project, we will primarily use REST due to prevalence throughout the industry. Later, we can provide a GraphQL interface in addition to the REST interface.
* This is basic Spring boot. We don't want things to be too fancy or crazy. KISS baby.
* If you touch existing code, leave it better than you found it.
* We're using conventional commits. Eventually, we'll generate release notes from commit messages, so get in the habit of this and try to keep things clean.

## Process for Contributions
1. Make sure you've read the above.
2. Check [TODOS.md](TODOS.md) for stuff to do.
    * We may move to Github Issues / Github Projects in the future, but a local ToDo list feels better right now.
3. Fork.
4. Submit a PR.
5. Mention @TheBeege on Discord on either of the two servers listed in [Communication](#communication).
Be patient because Beege is busy.
